# Admin Guide

Welcome to the unofficial Atlas Admin Documentation site. This site is aiming to document the various settings and parts
of the settings files to make the setup and management of an Atlas server easier, by putting all the useful information
in one place.

If you find any missing information, or something is wrong, please feel free to send a pull request with the changes, or
at least open an issue with what is needed correcting. As this is a work in progress, not everything will be available
to start with, but the more input we get the faster this can become a useful tool for all admins!
